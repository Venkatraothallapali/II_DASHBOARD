    overview: 'The US FDA has issued detailed guidance explaining how Bayesian statistical methods can be used in clinical trials for drugs and biological products. These methods allow prior knowledge and current trial data to be combined in a structured and transparent way. The guidance focuses on ensuring scientific rigor, regulatory reliability, and clear decision-making when Bayesian approaches are used to support safety and effectiveness conclusions.',
    summary: 'The FDA recognizes Bayesian methodology as a scientifically valid approach for clinical trial design and analysis when applied appropriately. At its core, Bayesian analysis combines prior information—such as data from previous studies, related populations, or external evidence—with data generated in the current trial to produce updated conclusions about treatment effects. The FDA emphasizes that Bayesian methods can be used across multiple stages of development, including dose-finding, adaptive trial designs, subgroup analyses, pediatric extrapolation, and trials in rare diseases or limited populations. However, the choice of Bayesian methods must always be justified, pre-specified, and aligned with the trial\'s regulatory objectives.\n\nA major focus of the guidance is the careful definition of success criteria and operating characteristics in Bayesian trials. Unlike traditional frequentist approaches that rely mainly on fixed error rates, Bayesian trials often use posterior probabilities to determine whether a treatment effect is clinically meaningful. The FDA highlights different approaches to defining success, including calibration to traditional Type I error rates, direct interpretation of posterior probabilities, and decision-theoretic frameworks that consider benefit–risk balance. Regardless of the approach, sponsors are expected to demonstrate—often through simulation—that the trial design leads to reliable, interpretable, and ethically sound conclusions.\n\nThe guidance also provides extensive direction on the selection and justification of prior distributions, which are central to Bayesian analysis. Noninformative or minimally informative priors may be used when little reliable prior information exists, while informative priors can be applied when borrowing external data is scientifically justified. When informative priors are used, the FDA expects transparent documentation of data sources, relevance, assumptions, and potential conflicts between prior information and observed trial data. Sensitivity analyses are strongly encouraged to show how conclusions may change under alternative prior assumptions. Overall, the FDA\'s position is supportive but cautious: Bayesian methods are encouraged where they improve efficiency and decision-making, provided they are rigorously planned, clearly documented, and capable of supporting robust regulatory decisions.'
